# Email Draft: Tinker API Access Request

**To**: tinker@thinkingmachines.ai

**Subject**: API Key Creation Issue + Research Interest in Cross-Domain Transfer

## Email Body

Hi Tinker Team,

I'm a researcher interested in using Tinker for studying cross-domain transfer in fine-tuned language models. I've been exploring the documentation and cookbook, and I'm excited about the platform's potential for this research.

### Issue

I've gained access to the Tinker console (https://tinker-console.thinkingmachines.ai), but I'm experiencing an issue with API key creation:

- **Problem**: The button to create an API key doesn't respond when clicked
- **Browser**: [Your browser + version, e.g., Chrome 120]
- **Attempted**: Tried different browsers, cleared cache, disabled extensions
- **Console errors**: [Note any JavaScript errors you see in browser console, or "None visible"]

Could you help me resolve this issue or manually provision an API key for my account?

### Research Interest

I'm planning to study **cross-domain transfer** - specifically, how reasoning capabilities transfer between domains like:
- Math → Code
- Chemistry → Biology
- Logic → Law

This research would:
1. Help understand what models actually learn during fine-tuning
2. Provide practical guidance for the Tinker community on efficient training
3. Potentially contribute to reducing training costs for data-scarce domains

I've prepared a detailed research proposal and would be happy to share findings with the community.

### Questions

1. Can you help resolve the API key creation issue?
2. Is there anything specific I should know about using Tinker for transfer learning experiments?
3. Are there compute limits during the beta that I should plan around?

Thank you for building Tinker - the ability to focus on algorithms rather than infrastructure is exactly what academic research needs.

Best regards,
